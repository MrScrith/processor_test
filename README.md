# processor_test
Processor Definition test app (console)

This is a processor of my own design that I am implementing in Java, eventually I would like to implement this in a Minecraft MOD, and in an FPGA (so eventually there will be a couple more repos for this CPU, but for the  moment this is it).

There is also a Pybox_tools repo, this will have the assembler and compiler for the code.
